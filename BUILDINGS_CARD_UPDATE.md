# Buildings Card Update - Complete

## Changes Made:

### 1. Replaced BuildingCard with PropertyCardV5
- Buildings now use the same card component as properties for consistency
- Removed the separate BuildingCard component import

### 2. Created formatBuildingForCard Function
Transforms building data to match PropertyCardV5 format:
- **Price**: Shows `price_range` or "Price on Request"
- **Bedrooms**: Shows total units (e.g., "3 Units")
- **Bathrooms**: Shows floors (e.g., "4 Floors")
- **Sqft**: Shows year built (e.g., "Built 2003")
- **Address**: Shows building address
- **Property Type**: Shows building type (e.g., "condominium")
- **Images**: Uses main_image with fallback to placeholder

### 3. Updated Both Views
- **Grid View**: Buildings display in the same 4-column grid as properties
- **Mixed View**: Buildings use the same mobile card size as properties

### 4. Removed Default Filters
- Buildings search doesn't apply any default filters
- Only sends filters that are explicitly set by the user

## Test Your Changes:

   - "Built 2003" instead of square footage
