# Fix for "Cannot redeclare AmpreApiService::getPropertiesImages()" Error

## Issue Fixed ✅

The error was caused by a **duplicate method declaration** in the `AmpreApiService` class. The `getPropertiesImages()` method was declared twice in the same file.

## What Was Fixed

- **Removed**: Duplicate `getPropertiesImages()` method from the end of the file
- **Kept**: The original method declaration (around line 264) which has the proper implementation

## Files Modified

- `app/Services/AmpreApiService.php` - Removed duplicate method

## Next Steps

1. **Clear caches** to ensure the fix takes effect:
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

2. **Test the search page** by visiting `/search`

## Root Cause

This likely happened when the file was edited multiple times and the same method got added twice accidentally. This is now resolved.

## Verification

The search page should now load without the "Cannot redeclare" error and show:
- ✅ Real MLS property data
- ✅ Proper image loading
- ✅ Clean plugin-style design
- ✅ No colored chips on cards

The search functionality should now work exactly like the WordPress plugin!
