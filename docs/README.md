# Laravel React Starter - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This is a Laravel-React application starter template with a well-organized website structure for scalable development.

## Structure Documentation

### Website Architecture
All website-related components follow a structured organization pattern:

```
resources/js/Website/
â”œâ”€â”€ [PageName].jsx          # Main page components
â”œâ”€â”€ Global/                 # Shared components
â””â”€â”€ Sections/              # Page-specific sections
    â””â”€â”€ [PageName]/        # Sections for each page
```

For detailed information about the website structure and guidelines, see: [Website Structure Documentation](./WEBSITE_STRUCTURE_README.md)
