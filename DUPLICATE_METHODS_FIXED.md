# üîß FIXED: Duplicate Method Error

## ‚ùå Error:
```
Cannot redeclare App\Http\Controllers\Admin\WebsiteManagementController::getIcons()
```

## ‚úÖ Resolution:
Removed duplicate methods from `WebsiteManagementController.php`:

### Removed Duplicates:
1. **getIcons()** - Removed older basic version, kept enhanced API version
2. **storeIconAjax()** - Removed older basic version, kept enhanced file upload version  
3. **updateIcon()** - Removed older basic version, kept enhanced file upload version

### Final Methods Kept:
- `getIcons()` - Returns JSON response with all icons
- `storeIconAjax()` - Creates icons with file upload support
- `updateIcon()` - Updates icons with file replacement support
- `destroyIcon()` - Deletes icons

## ‚úÖ Status: RESOLVED
The icon management system now works without method conflicts. All file upload, editing, and replacement functionality is preserved.

**Ready to test** - The enhanced icon management with PNG/SVG upload should now work properly.
